ERC777-K
=======

Below we describe ERC777-K, our formal specification of a refined variant
of the ERC777 standard token in K.
Here we assume the reader is already familiar with K, ERC20, and basic
formal specification notions and notations.
We strongly recommend the reader who is not already familiar with the K
formal specification of ERC20 to consult
[ERC20-K](https://github.com/runtimeverification/erc20-semantics).

Our objective is to define ERC777-K in such a way that it can be imported
by an arbitrary programming language semantics, whose programs can then make
use of the ERC777-K functions.
Our immediate reason for doing so is to test ERC777-K programmatically.
But this design choice can have other advantages, too.
For example, it can be seen as a way to *plug-and-play* ERC777-K support
to your favorite language, provided you have a K semantics for it.

As is customary for a K definition, we divide it into 2 modules: 
`ERC777-SYNTAX` for the syntax and `ERC777` for the actual semantic rules.  

## 1 Syntax

We start by defining the module `ERC777-SYNTAX`.
It contains the syntactic definitions for the entities defined in the
ERC777 standard, such as the syntactic categories with their relationships,
the functions and the events.
Additional, auxiliary syntactic definitions are included in module `ERC777`.
```{.k}
module ERC777-SYNTAX
  imports DOMAINS
```

### 1.1 Syntactic sorts

ERC777 refers to three major data types: `uint256`, `address` and `bytes`.
Type `uint256` is used for token values, and corresponds to `ValueType` in 
ERC777-K.
(We use `ValueType` here to avoid name collision with variables called `Value`.)
Type `address` corresponds to `Address` here.
These two types are natural numbers, so we model them as K unbounded integers
using the builtin sort `Int`.
The third essential type, `bytes`, is essentially used to pass messages across
various operations.
It corresponds to `Data` in ERC777-K, modeled as `String`. 
```{.k}
  syntax Address ::= Int
  syntax ValueType ::= Int
  syntax Data ::= String
```

Additionally, ERC777 mentions the type `string`, which is modeled by K's
`String`, and `bool`, which is modeled by K's `Bool`.

Next we define expression sorts that are later used to define ERC777 functions. 
All numeric expressions are captured by `AExp`.
It thus includes both `Address` and `ValueType`.
`BExp` captures boolean expressions.
The auxiliary construct `#void` represents the return value of functions that
don't have a return type.
It allows a more uniform semantics for functions.
In addition, we need the base expression type `Exp` which captures all possible 
expressions, including those not captured by more particular sorts.
(`SetExp` will be described later).
```{.k}
  syntax AExp  ::= ValueType | Address
  syntax BExp  ::= Bool

  syntax Void ::= "#void"
  
  syntax Exp ::= AExp | BExp | SetExp | Data | Void
```

### 1.2 Main functions

Next we define the ERC777 functions.

The two functions below are constant, returning `String`:
```{.k}
  syntax Exp ::= name ( )
               | symbol ( )
```
Since ERC777 doesn't define any operations over strings, we don't need a
separate sort for string expressions.
Thus we subsort them directly to `Exp`.

Here are the remaining functions from the standard:
```{.k}
  syntax AExp ::= totalSupply ( )
                | balanceOf ( AExp ) [strict]
                | granularity ( )

  syntax SetExp ::= defaultOperators ( )
                  | Set

  syntax BExp ::= isOperatorFor ( AExp , AExp ) [strict]

  syntax Exp ::=  authorizeOperator ( AExp )                        [strict]
                | revokeOperator ( AExp )                           [strict]
                | send ( AExp , AExp , Data )                       [strict]
                | operatorSend ( AExp , AExp , AExp , Data , Data ) [strict]
                | burn ( AExp )                                     [strict]
                | operatorBurn ( AExp , AExp , Data )               [strict]
                | "revert"
```
We use the K strictness mechanism to allow these functions to be used in
programs, with expressions passed as arguments.
Note that although not used in
[ERC20-K](https://github.com/runtimeverification/erc20-semantics), K supports
the sugared notation `symbol(Sort1,Sort2,...,SortN)` for declaring syntactic
constructs, which desugars as expected to
`"symbol" "(" Sort1 "," Sort2 "," ... "," SortN ")"`.
The function `defaultOperators` returns an `address[]` in the standard.
Here we use the sort `SetExp` for the function, and generic `Set` for the
actual array of addresses.
All functions that don't return a value are subsorted directly to `Exp`.
The construct `revert` above represents the function execution result `revert`
mentioned in the standard.

In addition, we define one more function that is not part of the standard:
```{.k}  
  syntax Exp ::=  operatorMint ( AExp , //from
                                 AExp , //amount
                                 Data , //data
                                 Data   //operatorData.
                               ) [strict]
```
ERC-777 does not define a specific function for minting, but it allows the
minting operation through additional functions and defines a set of rules that
must be followed when minting tokens.
To capture these rules formally, it is convenient to define the function
`operatorMint` with a semantics symmetrical to `operatorBurn` (as seen shortly).

### 1.3 Events

The ERC777 functions are required, at success, to log the following events:
```{.k}
  syntax Event ::= Sent ( Address , Address , Address , ValueType , Data , Data )
                 | Minted ( Address , Address , ValueType , Data , Data )
                 | Burned ( Address , Address , ValueType , Data )
                 | AuthorizedOperator ( Address , Address )
                 | RevokedOperator ( Address , Address )
```

The events are then collected in a log.
The precise syntax of the log is not specified in the ERC777 standard, so
in ERC777-K we take the freedom to choose the same syntax that was used in
ERC20-K, that is, `Events: <event1> <event2> ... <eventn>`:

```{.k}
  syntax EventLog ::= "Events:" | EventLog Event
```

The syntax of the event log is unconstrained (by semantic rules) and
is irrelevant for implementations.
All the above is saying is that implementations of ERC777-K must implement
the notion of an event log, together with an *empty* event log and the
capability to *append* a new event to an existing event log.

### 1.4 Hooks

The main addition of ERC-777 over ERC-20 are two function "hooks":
`tokensToSend` and `tokensReceived`.
These are function interfaces which can be registered by an address, and will
be called whenever an operation that removes tokens, or adds tokens to the
respective address is invoked.

Below we define the 2 hooks:
```{.k}
  syntax Stmt ::= AExp "." "tokensToSend" "(" AExp "," AExp "," AExp "," AExp "," Data "," Data ")" [strict]

  syntax Stmt ::= AExp "." "tokensReceived" "(" AExp "," AExp "," AExp "," AExp "," Data "," Data ")" [strict]
```
Here the qualifier (before ".") represents the hook address, and the function 
arguments are the same as in the standard.

### 1.5 ERC20-compatibility

ERC777 defines additional rules that must be preserved when an ERC777 token
contract is specified to be compatible with ERC20 (note that compatibility with
ERC20 is optional).
There are additional rules both for ERC777 functions and for ERC20.
To capture them, we decided to fully model ERC777+ERC20 in ERC777-K.
Thus, we also define all ERC20 functions and events:
```{.k}
  syntax AExp ::= allowance ( AExp , AExp ) [strict]
                | decimals ( )

  syntax BExp ::= approve ( AExp , AExp )             [strict]
                | transfer ( AExp , AExp )            [strict]
                | transferFrom ( AExp , AExp , AExp ) [strict]

  syntax Event ::= Transfer ( Address , Address , ValueType)
                 | Approval ( Address , Address , ValueType)

```

This completes the syntax module.
```{.k}
endmodule
```

## 2 Configuration

The second module contains the configuration and the actual execution rules.

```{.k}
require "erc777-syntax.k"

module ERC777

  imports ERC777-SYNTAX
  imports INT
  imports BOOL
  imports STRING
  imports MAP
  imports SET
  imports LIST
  imports KCELLS
```

Next we present the configuration and the meaning of each cell:
```{.k}
  configuration
     <ERC777>
       <caller> 0:Address </caller>
       <k> $PGM:K </k>
       <accounts>
         <account multiplicity="*">
           <id> 0:Address </id>
           <balance> 0:ValueType </balance>

           <operators> .Set </operators>
           <senderHook> 0:Address </senderHook>
           <receiverHook> 0:Address </receiverHook>
           <isContract> . </isContract>
           <allowances>
             <allow multiplicity="*">
               <spender> 0:Address </spender>
               <amount> 0:ValueType </amount>
             </allow>
           </allowances>
         </account>
       </accounts>
       <supply> 0:ValueType </supply>
       <nameC> "" </nameC>
       <symbolC> "" </symbolC>
       <granularityC> 1 </granularityC>
       <defaultOperatorsC> .Set </defaultOperatorsC>
       <ERC20CompatibleC> true </ERC20CompatibleC>
       <acceptRegularNoReceiverHook> true </acceptRegularNoReceiverHook>
       <burnAllowed> true </burnAllowed>
       <log> Events: </log> // event*
       <atomic> . </atomic>
     </ERC777>
```
- `<caller>` - the caller address.
- `<k>` - computation cell.
- `<account>` - all information relevant to one account.
  - `<id>` - account address, key to the account.
  - `<balance>` - token balance.
  - `<operators>` - the set of operators for this account. Initialized with the 
  default operators.
  - `<senderHook>` - address of the sender hook registered for this account, 
  or 0 if there is no hook.
  - `<receiverHook>` - address of the receiver hook registered for this account, 
  or 0 if there is no hook.
  - `<isContract>` - whether this account is a contract or a regular account.
  - `<allowances>` - ERC20 allowances associated with this account, which are 
  completely separated from ERC777's `<operators>`, as required by the standard; 
  the allowances are initialized with an allowance entry for any account in the 
  configuration, with allowance 0.
    - `<spender>` - spender account for this particular account.
    - `<amount>` - allowance amount for this <account, spender> pair.
- `<supply>` - total supply in this contract.
- `<nameC>` - token name, returned by `name()`.
- `<symbolC>` - symbol of the token, returned by `symbol()`.
- `<granularityC>` - contract granularity.
- `<defaultOperatorsC>` - set of default operators, used to initialize
`<operators>` when a new account is created.
- `<ERC20CompatibleC>` - contract parameter: says whether the contract is
ERC20 compatible; it affects the types of logs created.
- `<acceptRegularNoReceiverHook>` - contract parameter: if true, regular
addresses with no receiver hook can receive tokens through send or mint
operations; if false, such operations will result in revert.
- `<burnAllowed>` - contract parameter: if true, burn operations are allowed;
otherwise they result in revert.
- `<log>` - events log.
- `<atomic>` - backup cell that stores old values of certain cells at the
beginning of an ERC-777 function; used to define the `revert` operation.

For the remainder of the semantics, we assume the configuration is already
*correctly* initialized: all the account `<id/>`s are distinct, their
`<balance/>`s are non-negative, and the total `<supply/>` is the sum of all
the balances) and the `<caller/>` is known.
In our simple IMP programming language that we define on top of the ERC777-K
semantics (in `erc777-imp.k`) we define macros that can be used to
initialize the configuration.

## 3 Semantics

ERC777 was originally designed for the EVM, whose integers
(of type `uint256`) are unsigned and have `256` bits, so can go up
to `2^256`.
The exact size of integers is important for arithmetic overflow,
which needs to be rigorously defined in the formal specification.
However, the precise size of integers can be a parameter of the
ERC777-K specification.
This way, the specification can easily be used with various execution
environments, such as [eWASM](https://github.com/ewasm/) or 
[IELE](https://github.com/runtimeverification/iele-semantics), or
with various programming languages
(e.g., [Viper](https://github.com/ethereum/viper) appears to converge
towards integers up to `2^128`).
The syntax declaration and the rule below define an integer
constant `#MAXVALUE` and initialize it with the largest integer
on 256 bits (one can set it to "infinity" if one does not care about
overflows or if one's computational infrastructure supports unbounded
integers, like
[IELE](https://github.com/runtimeverification/iele-semantics) does):

```{.k}
  syntax Int ::= "#MAXVALUE"  [function]
  rule #MAXVALUE => 2 ^Int 256 -Int 1
```

### 3.1 Constant functions

The rules below define the semantics of four constant functions, simply by
reading the value from corresponding cell:

```{.k}
  rule <k> name ( ) => NAME ...</k>
       <nameC> NAME </nameC>

  rule <k> symbol ( ) => SYMBOL ...</k>
       <symbolC> SYMBOL </symbolC>

  rule <k> granularity ( ) => G ...</k>
       <granularityC> G </granularityC>

  rule <k> defaultOperators ( ) => DefOps ...</k>
       <defaultOperatorsC> DefOps </defaultOperatorsC>
```

### 3.2 totalSupply

Similar to above, reading the value from `<supply>`"
```
  rule <k> totalSupply ( ) => TotalSupply ...</k>
       <supply> TotalSupply </supply>
```

### 3.3 balanceOf

For `balanceOf` we need two rules:

```{.k}
  rule <k> balanceOf ( Holder:Int  ) => Balance ...</k>
       <id> Holder </id>
       <balance> Balance </balance>
    requires Holder =/=Int 0

  //Required for send/operatorSend revert cases.
  rule balanceOf(0) => 0
```

The first rule represents the regular case, similar to ERC20:
it rewrites into the `<balance>` value associated with the given parameter.
The second rule is required for the case when parameter `Holder` is `0`.
Since `0` is an invalid address, we don't have an `<account>` cell for it,
thus the semantics for this case have to be defined through a separate rule.
This was not required to be special-cased in the specification of ERC20, but it
it required here in order to properly define the semantics of revert.

### 3.4 isOperatorFor

Similar to `balanceOf`:

```{.k}
  rule <k> isOperatorFor ( Operator:Int , Holder:Int )
        => Operator in Operators ...</k>
       <id> Holder </id>
       <operators> Operators:Set </operators>
    requires Holder =/=Int 0

  rule isOperatorFor(_, 0) => false
```

### 3.5 authorizeOperator

```{.k}
  rule <k> authorizeOperator ( Operator:Int ) => #void ...</k>
       <caller> Holder </caller>
       <id> Holder </id>
       <operators> Operators => Operators SetItem(Operator) </operators>
       <log> Log => Log AuthorizedOperator ( Operator , Holder ) </log>
       requires Holder =/=Int Operator andBool Operator =/=Int 0

  rule <k> authorizeOperator ( Operator:Int ) => revert ...</k>
       <caller> Holder </caller>
       requires Holder ==Int Operator orBool Operator ==Int 0
```
The first rule above corresponds to the valid call of `authorizeOperator`:
caller different from argument and argument different from `0`.
ERC777 states that an account (caller) cannot authorize or revoke authorization
from itself. 
The rule adds the argument to the list of operators of the caller, and
generates the log event `AuthorizedOperator`.

The second rule represents the invalid call, all other cases, which generates
a `revert`.

The `revert` construct has no other semantics in this module, but is printed
to the output for debug purposes in the `ERC777-IMP` module. 

### 3.6 revokeOperator

Requires two similar rules.
Successful operation generates the log event `RevokedOperator`.
```{.k}
  rule <k> revokeOperator ( Operator:Int ) => #void ...</k>
       <caller> Holder </caller>
       <id> Holder </id>
       <operators> Operators => Operators -Set SetItem(Operator) </operators>
       <log> Log => Log RevokedOperator ( Operator , Holder ) </log>
       requires Holder =/=Int Operator andBool Operator =/=Int 0

  rule <k> revokeOperator ( Operator:Int ) => revert ...</k>
       <caller> Holder </caller>
       requires Holder ==Int Operator orBool Operator ==Int 0
```

### 3.7 send and operatorSend

#### 3.7.1 send

The `send` function is simply an alias to `operatorSend` with first argument
the caller:
```{.k}
  rule <k>         send (          To:Int , Value:Int , Data      )
        => operatorSend ( Holder , To     , Value     , Data , "" ) ...</k>
       <caller> Holder </caller>
```

#### 3.7.2 operatorSend - initial rules

The `operatorSend` function requires many steps defined through auxiliary
constructs.
All together they represent the bulk of the semantics.
We start with two initial rules:
```{.k}
  rule <k> operatorSend ( 0 => Caller , _,_,_,_ ) ...</k>
       <caller> Caller </caller>
    requires Caller =/=Int 0 //just for safety

  rule operatorSend ( From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData )
       => #operatorSendAux ( From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData , balanceOf(From), balanceOf(To) )
    requires From =/=Int 0 //just for safety
```
The first rule deals with the case when the first argument (`From`) is `0`.
According to ERC777, in this case the `From` value should become the caller.
The second rule rewrites `operatorSend` into the auxiliary construct
`#operatorSendAux` and uses K's strictness mechanism to compute a few more
values: the balance of `From` and the balance of `To`.

#### 3.7.3 #operatorSendAux

Here we define the bulk of the logic of `operatorSend`.
The `#operatorSendAux` is rewritten into a sequence of operations, each
carrying a specific step defined in ERC777.
Recall that the K infix construct `~>`, read "followed by", is used to
sequentialize computational tasks.

```{.k}
  syntax K ::= "#operatorSendAux" "(" Address "," Address "," ValueType "," Data "," Data "," AExp "," AExp ")" [seqstrict(6,7)]

  rule <k> #operatorSendAux ( From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData , BalanceFrom:Int, BalanceTo:Int )
        => #atomicBegin
        ~> #ensure( #and(
              From =/=Int 0,
              To =/=Int 0,
              isOperatorFor ( Operator , From ),
              Value >=Int 0,
              BalanceFrom >=Int Value,
              #isMultipleOf ( Value , granularity() ) ))
        ~> #callSender ( Operator , From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData )
        ~> #transfer ( From , To , Value )
        ~> #callRecipient ( Operator , From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData , false )
        ~> #log( Sent(Operator , From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData) )
        ~> #logERC20( Transfer(From , To , Value) )
        ~> #atomicEnd(#void) ...</k>
       <caller> Operator </caller>
```

The first construct, `#atomicBegin`, saves the relevant part of the
configuration into the cell `<atomic>`.
It is then later used to revert all changes in case the operation ends in
`revert`.

The `#ensure` clause checks all the preconditions that must be true in order
for the operation to succeed.
If its argument expression evaluates to false, the operation ends in `revert`.
Note that overflow is not checked here, because the new balance is guaranteed
to be less than or equal to `totalSupply`, and thus cannot overflow.

The `#callSender` calls the sender hook for the `From` address, if it exists.
The `#transfer` performs the actual balance transfer.
Next, `#callRecipient` calls the receiver hook for the `To` address,
if it exists.
Because the call is performed after the balance transfer, the new balances 
will be visible inside the receiver hook.

The `#log` construct will log the ERC777-specific event `Send`.
Then the `#logERC20` construct will log the ERC20-specific `Transfer`, only
when ERC20 compatibility is enabled.

The last construct, `#atomicEnd`, deletes the backup data created by
`#atomicBegin` if the operation completed successfully.
The argument of `#atomicEnd` is required in order to correctly and uniformly
model function return, as discussed shortly.

#### 3.7.4 #callSender

There are two rules for `#callSender`, one for the case when `Hook` is
registered (i.e., different from `0`) and the other for the case when it's
not registered: 

```{.k}
  syntax Stmt ::= #callSender ( Address , // operator
                                Address , // from
                                Address , // to
                                ValueType ,  // amount
                                Data ,    // userData
                                Data      // operatorData
                              )

  rule <k> #callSender ( Operator , From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData )
        => Hook . tokensToSend ( Operator , From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData ) ...</k>
       <id> From </id>
       <senderHook> Hook </senderHook>
       requires Hook =/=Int 0

  rule <k> #callSender ( Operator , From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData ) => . ...</k>
       <id> From </id>
       <senderHook> 0 </senderHook>
```

When a hook is registered, `#callSender` is rewritten into `tokensToSend`
qualified by the hook registration address.
ERC777-K does not define any specific behavior for `tokensToSend`.
In the extension module `ERC777-IMP` we provide two implementations, for
testing purposes:
one that accepts the operation and another that reverts.
Note that the behavior of the hook is *not* part of the ERC777 standard, which
is why we do not define it as part of our ERC777-K.

If the hook produces `revert`, it will be propagated by rules that are
presented shortly.

The second rule, for the case when the hook is not registered,
simply dissolves `#callSender`.
Recall that in K `.` means the "empty computation".

#### 3.7.5 #callRecipient

There are two rules here, similar to the rules for `#callSender`:

```{.k}
  syntax Stmt ::= #callRecipient ( Address , // operator
                                   Address , // from
                                   Address , // to
                                   ValueType ,  // amount
                                   Data ,    // userData
                                   Data ,    // operatorData
                                   Bool      // fromERC20: called by ERC20 functions
                                 )

  rule <k> #callRecipient ( Operator , From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData , _ )
        => Hook . tokensReceived ( Operator , From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData ) ...</k>
       <id> To </id>
       <receiverHook> Hook </receiverHook>
       requires Hook =/=Int 0

  rule <k> #callRecipient ( Operator , From , To , Value , Data , OperatorData , FromERC20 )
        => #ite( #or(FromERC20, #and(AcceptRegular, notBool ISCONTRACT) ) , . , revert ) ...</k>
       <id> To </id>
       <receiverHook> 0 </receiverHook>
       <isContract> ISCONTRACT </isContract>
       <acceptRegularNoReceiverHook> AcceptRegular </acceptRegularNoReceiverHook>
```

There is one additional rule when receiver account does not register a 
`tokensReceived` hook. If token transfer happens during a `send` or `mint`
operation and receiver is a contract account, then operation "MUST revert".
If transfer happens as part of ERC20 `transfer` operation, then
the receiver "SHOULD accept" the operation (wording from ERC777).
This functionality is implemented in the 2nd rule above, through the
conditional construct `#ite` (if-then-else).

#### 3.7.6 #transfer

This construct performs the actual balance transfer.
There are two rules.
The first one is for the case when the sender and the recipient are different,
when actual balance changes happen.
The second rule is for the case when the sender and the recipient are the same.
In this case, as expected, the balance remains unchanged.

```{.k}
  syntax Stmt ::= #transfer ( Address , Address , ValueType )

  rule <k> #transfer ( From , To , Value ) => . ...</k>
       <account>
         <id> From </id>
         <balance> ValueFrom => ValueFrom -Int Value </balance>
         ...
       </account>
       <account>
         <id> To </id>
         <balance> ValueTo => ValueTo +Int Value </balance>
         ...
       </account>
       requires From =/=Int To

  rule <k> #transfer ( From , To , Value ) => . ...</k>
       requires From ==Int To
```

There is no need for side conditions checking for operation validity, because
validity was already checked by the `#ensures` construct generated by the rule
for `operationSend`.

#### 3.7.7 #isMultipleOf

Another functionality required to define `operationSend` is the construct 
`#isMultipleOf`, which checks whether the amount involved in an operation
is a multiple of the global granularity:

```{.k}
  syntax BExp ::= #isMultipleOf ( AExp , AExp ) [seqstrict]

  rule #isMultipleOf ( Value:Int , Granularity:Int )
    => (Value /Int Granularity) *Int Granularity ==Int Value
```

#### 3.7.8 Logging

The last auxiliary constructs, used by all state-altering operations in
ERC777-K, are related to logging.
The construct `#log(Event)` is used for events defined in ERC777.
It simply appends the event to the `<log>` cell.

The construct `#logERC20` is used for ERC20-specific events.
It logs the given event only when ERC20 compatibility is enabled.

```{.k}
  syntax Stmt ::= #log ( Event )
                | #logERC20 ( Event )

  rule <k> #log(Log) => . ...</k>
       <log> Logs => Logs Log </log>

  rule <k> #logERC20(Log) => . ...</k>
       <log> Logs => Logs Log </log>
       <ERC20CompatibleC> true </ERC20CompatibleC>

  rule <k> #logERC20(Log) => . ...</k>
       <ERC20CompatibleC> false </ERC20CompatibleC>
```


#### 3.8 Burn operations

These are defined similarly to `send` and `operatorSend`.
They reuse many of the auxiliary constructs.

The ERC777 standard stipulates "Contract MAY prevent some/all holders from
burning for any reason". 
We model this choice in a simplified way through either allowing burn 
operations, or disallowing them globally. 
This behavior is controlled by the cell`<burnAllowed>`.
If it holds `true`, the burn operation will proceed according to other rules.
If it holds `false`, burn operation will revert.

```{.k}
  rule <k>         burn(        Amount:Int   )
        => operatorBurn(Caller, Amount,    "") ...</k>
       <caller> Caller </caller>

  rule <k> operatorBurn(0 => Caller, _,_) ...</k>
       <caller> Caller </caller>
    requires Caller =/=Int 0 //just for safety

  rule <k> operatorBurn(Holder:Int, Amount:Int, OperatorData)
        => #atomicBegin
        ~> #ensure(#and(isOperatorFor(Operator, Holder),
                        #isMultipleOf(Amount, granularity()),
                        Amount >=Int 0,
                        Balance >=Int Amount,
                        Holder =/=Int 0,
                        BurnAllowed))
        ~> #callSender(Operator, Holder, 0, Amount, "", OperatorData)
        ~> #burn(Holder, Amount)
        ~> #log(Burned(Operator, Holder, Amount, OperatorData))
        ~> #logERC20(Transfer(Holder, 0, Amount)) // ERC20
        ~> #atomicEnd(#void) ...</k>
       <caller> Operator </caller>
       <id> Holder </id>
       <balance> Balance </balance>
       <burnAllowed> BurnAllowed </burnAllowed>
    requires Holder =/=Int 0

  syntax Stmt ::= #burn ( Address , ValueType )

  rule <k> #burn(Holder, Amount) => . ...</k>
       <account>
         <id> Holder </id>
         <balance> Balance => Balance -Int Amount </balance>
         ...
       </account>
       <supply> Supply => Supply -Int Amount </supply>
       requires Balance >=Int Amount andBool Supply >=Int Amount
```

Calling `operatorBurn` with first argument `0` is allowed:
in this case `Holder` will become the caller
If holder has a sender hook registered, it is called before the operation by
using the already defined `#callSender`.
The actual balance decrease is performed by `#burn`.
Here, in addition to decreasing the balance, the total supply also decreases.

The burn operation uses the same mechanism as send for transaction atomicity,
enforcing preconditions and logging.
The ERC20 `Transfer` event has the `To` argument `0`, to represent burning.

### 3.9 operatorMint

ERC777 does not define specific functions to mint tokens.
Instead, it specifies several rules that MUST be respected when minting tokens.
The definition of below is a minimal realization of minting that conforms to
those rules.
We define the function `operationMint`, which must be called by an operator on
behalf of a recipient.
It follows the same structure as `operatorSend` and `operatorBurn`.

This function is not allowed to have its `Holder` argument `0`; that is, it
reverts when `Holder` is `0`.
The relevant hook for the mint operation is `tokensReceived`.
When the hook is not defined, this semantics allows all addresses to receive
tokens through minting.

```{.k}
  rule operatorMint(0,_,_,_) => revert

  rule <k> operatorMint(Holder, Amount, Data, OperatorData)
        => #atomicBegin
        ~> #ensure(#and(Amount >=Int 0,
                        Supply +Int Amount <=Int #MAXVALUE,
                        #isMultipleOf(Amount, granularity()),
                        Holder =/=Int 0,
                        isOperatorFor( Operator , Holder )))
        ~> #mint(Holder, Amount)
        ~> #callRecipient(Operator, 0, Holder, Amount, Data, OperatorData, false)
        ~> #log(Minted(Operator, Holder, Amount, Data, OperatorData))
        ~> #logERC20(Transfer(0, Holder, Amount))
        ~> #atomicEnd(#void) ...</k>
       <caller> Operator </caller>
       <id> Holder </id>
       <supply> Supply </supply>
    requires Holder =/=Int 0

  syntax Stmt ::= #mint ( Address , ValueType )

  rule <k> #mint(Holder, Amount) => . ...</k>
       <account>
         <id> Holder </id>
         <balance> Balance => Balance +Int Amount </balance>
         ...
       </account>
       <supply> Supply => Supply +Int Amount </supply>
```

### 3.10 ERC20 functions

In this section we have the rules for ERC20 functions.
There are several differences compared to the same rules in
[ERC20-K](https://github.com/runtimeverification/erc20-semantics).
First, the `transfer` operation logs *two* events: the ERC20 `Transfer`
and the ERC777 `Sent`.
Second, we use the `#atomicBegin ... #atomicEnd` transaction mechanism that we
defined, in order to rollback the transaction if it ends in revert.
Third, the `transfer` operation calls the sender and the recipient hooks,
as required by the ERC777 standard.

Another, more subtle difference, is the return type.
ERC777 state-changing functions don't return a value, while ERC20 functions
should return boolean value `true` st success.
This return value is represented by the argument of `#atomicEnd`, which we
define later.

```{.k}
  rule <k> allowance(Owner:Int, Spender:Int) => Allowance ...</k>
       <id> Owner </id>
       <spender> Spender </spender>
       <amount> Allowance </amount>
```

ERC777 restricts this function value to 18. 
E.g. 1 unit in user representation = 10^18 tokens. 
Similar to Wei vs Ether relation.  

```{.k}
  rule <k> decimals() => 18 ...</k>
```

```{.k}
  rule <k> approve(Spender:Int, Allowance:Int) => true ...</k>
       <caller> Owner </caller>
       <id> Owner </id>
       <spender> Spender </spender>
       <amount> _ => Allowance </amount>
       <log> Log => Log Approval(Owner, Spender, Allowance) </log>
       requires Allowance >=Int 0

  rule <k> approve(Spender:Int, Allowance:Int) => revert ...</k>
       <caller> Owner </caller>
       <id> Owner </id>
       <spender> Spender </spender>
       <amount> _ => Allowance </amount>
       requires Allowance <Int 0

  rule <k> transfer(To:Int, Value:Int) => #transferAux(To, Value, balanceOf(From), balanceOf(To)) ...</k>
       <caller> From </caller>

  syntax K ::= "#transferAux" "(" Address "," ValueType "," AExp "," AExp ")" [seqstrict(3,4)]
  rule <k> #transferAux(To:Int, Value:Int, BalanceFrom:Int, BalanceTo:Int)
        => #atomicBegin
        ~> #ensure(#and(Value >=Int 0,
                        BalanceFrom >=Int Value,
                        #isMultipleOf(Value, granularity()),
                        #or(From ==Int To, BalanceTo +Int Value <=Int #MAXVALUE)))
        ~> #callSender(From, From, To, Value, "", "")
        ~> #transfer(From, To, Value)
        ~> #callRecipient(From, From, To, Value, "", "", true) // should accept even if To isn't registered and To is contract )
        ~> #log(Transfer(From, To, Value))
        ~> #log(Sent(From, From, To, Value, "", ""))
        ~> #atomicEnd(true) ...</k>

  rule transferFrom(From:Int, To:Int, Value:Int)
       => #transferFromAux(From, To, Value, balanceOf(From), balanceOf(To))

  rule <k> #transferFromAux(From, To, Value, BalanceFrom:Int, BalanceTo:Int)

        ~> #ensure(#and(Value >=Int 0,
                        BalanceFrom >=Int Value,
                        #isMultipleOf(Value, granularity()),
                        #or(From ==Int To, BalanceTo +Int Value <=Int #MAXVALUE),

         <amount> Allowed => Allowed -Int Value </amount>
         ...
       </account>
       requires From ==Int To
```

### 3.11 #atomicBegin, #atomicEnd

The construct `#atomicBegin` is the first operation performed by `operatoSend`, 
`operatorBurn`, `operatorMint`:

```{.k}
  syntax KItem ::= "#atomicBegin"
                 | "#atomicEnd" "(" K /*output*/ ")"
                 | #snapshot ( K , EventLog , ValueType )

  rule <k> #atomicBegin => . ...</k>
       <accounts> Accounts </accounts>
       <log> Log </log>
       <supply> Supply </supply>
       <atomic> . => #snapshot ( Accounts , Log , Supply ) </atomic>
```

It stores the contents (or a "snapshot") of cells `<accounts>`, `<log>`, and
`<supply>` into `<atomic>`, to be used in case a `revert` operation happens.
Note that this semantics, which is sufficient for ERC777, allows only one
snapshot to be stored; in particular, snapshots cannot be stacked.

```{.k}
  rule <k> #atomicEnd(OUT:K) => OUT ...</k>
       <atomic> _ => . </atomic>
```
The construct `#atomicEnd` marks the end of the operation/function.
If this construct is reached, it means that the operation/function was
executed successfully, so the contents of `<atomic>` is unnecessary and thus
discarded.
Additionally, the `#atomicEnd` is rewritten into its argument, which contains
the return value.
This value is `true` for functions that return `true` in case of success
(ERC20), or `#void` for functions that don't have return values (ERC777).

### 3.12 revert

We have two rules for `revert`:
```{.k}
  rule <k> revert ~> (KI:KItem => .) ...</k>
       <atomic> #snapshot(_,_,_) </atomic>
  requires (KI =/=K #atomicEnd(#void)) andBool (KI =/=K #atomicEnd(true))

  rule <k> revert ~> (#atomicEnd(_) => .) ...</k>
       <accounts> _ => Accounts </accounts>
       <log> _ => Log </log>
       <supply> _ => Supply </supply>
       <atomic> #snapshot ( Accounts , Log , Supply ) => . </atomic>
```

Both rules match only in the case when `<atomic>` is not empty, that is, when
we are inside an ERC777 or ERC20 function.
The first rule deletes any K item after `revert`, except `atomicEnd`, the only 
item with which revert can interact.
The second rule matches when revert is followed by `#atomicEnd`.
It restores the state stored in `<atomic>` and keeps `revert` at the top of
computation.
Thus, once triggered, `revert` is always propagated outside the function that
generated it.
In module `ERC777-IMP` there are additional rules that print a message to the
output when `revert` is encountered, and allow the computation to continue.

### 3.13 Utility constructs

The last section of the `ERC777` module contains a collection of K utility
functions:
- `#ensure` evaluates the preconditions of a function; if the argument
evaluates to `true` then the computation is allowed to continue, otherwise
a `revert` is generated.
- `#ite` represents a general-purpose conditional operator with support for
strictness.
- `#and` and `#or` operators implement boolean expressions with strictness,
to be used as arguments to `#ensures`.

```{.k}
  syntax Stmt ::= #ensure ( BExp ) [strict]

  rule #ensure ( B:Bool ) => .       requires B
  rule #ensure ( B:Bool ) => revert  requires notBool B

  syntax K ::= #ite ( BExp , K , K ) [strict(1)]

  rule #ite ( true , T , F ) => T
  rule #ite ( false , T , F ) => F
```

Here we define multiple versions of `#and` that differ only in the number of 
parameters. 
Although we could have used only the 2-parameter version and nesting, we prefer 
these multiple versions for readability.

```{.k}
  syntax BExp ::= "#and" "(" BExp "," BExp ")"                                     [strict]
                | "#and" "(" BExp "," BExp "," BExp ")"                            [strict]
                | "#and" "(" BExp "," BExp "," BExp "," BExp ")"                   [strict]
                | "#and" "(" BExp "," BExp "," BExp "," BExp "," BExp ")"          [strict]
                | "#and" "(" BExp "," BExp "," BExp "," BExp "," BExp "," BExp ")" [strict]
                | "#and" "(" BExp "," BExp "," BExp "," BExp "," BExp "," BExp "," BExp ")" [strict]
                | "#or"  "(" BExp "," BExp ")"                                     [strict]

  rule #and ( A:Bool , B:Bool )                                     => A andBool B
  rule #and ( A:Bool , B:Bool , C:Bool )                            => A andBool B andBool C
  rule #and ( A:Bool , B:Bool , C:Bool , D:Bool )                   => A andBool B andBool C andBool D
  rule #and ( A:Bool , B:Bool , C:Bool , D:Bool , E:Bool )          => A andBool B andBool C andBool D andBool E
  rule #and ( A:Bool , B:Bool , C:Bool , D:Bool , E:Bool , F:Bool ) => A andBool B andBool C andBool D andBool E andBool F
  rule #and ( A:Bool , B:Bool , C:Bool , D:Bool , E:Bool , F:Bool , G:Bool )
       => A andBool B andBool C andBool D andBool E andBool F andBool G
  rule #or  ( A:Bool , B:Bool )                                     => A orBool B

endmodule
```

## 4 How To Use ERC777-K

One way to use ERC777-K, illustrated in module `ERC777-IMP` and [tests](tests), 
is to import it in other programming language semantics and thus offer ERC777
support to those languages.
In particular, this can be useful to test the ERC777-K specification
programmatically, as well as for producing tests that can be then used with
implementations of ERC777.

Another way to use ERC777-K is as a standard for ERC777 compliance.
That is, as an answer to *what* needs to be proved about a smart contract
claiming to implement an ERC777 token.
Each of the rules above is one reachability claim that needs to be proved.

See the
[ERC20-K](https://github.com/runtimeverification/erc20-semantics) project for a
similar (but simpler) formal semantics, for the ERC20 standard, as well as for
more explanations about K.
