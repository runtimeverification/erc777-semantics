test.preamble();

// Testing transfer(To,Value) when To != caller, with allowance assigned
// specifically lower than Value.  So the allowance is irrelevant for transfer.
// The allowance is only relevant for transferFrom.

test.approve(caller, 20);   // set allowance of caller for itself below 23
test.transfer(4, 23);   // transfer 23 to 4, which is larger than allowance 20
