Methodology
=================================
    - will select a relevant subset of existing tests, and run them with <printLog> enabled.

List of logging events:
=================================
    - Sent, Minted, Burned, AuthorizedOperator, RevokedOperator

About ERC20 logs:
    - we don't test them specifically here, so won't pick separate tests for these hooks.


Variables to test
=================================

ERC777 only for now
----------------------------------
All operations that generate logs:
    - send, operatorSend, burn, operatorBurn, operatorMint, authorizeOperator, revokeOperator

For each operation:
    - a test with success and a test with failure (no hooks)

For hooks:
    - for each operation, additionally a test with all hooks enabled, both accepting and rejecting hooks.

For send (most complex) we'll have following cases:
    - 2 hooks accepting
    - sender hook rejecting, receiver accepting
    - sender accepting, receiver rejecting
