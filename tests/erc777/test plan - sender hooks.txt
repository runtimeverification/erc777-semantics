Notes from ERC777 semantics
=================================
NOTE 1: Multiple token holders MAY use the same implementation of ERC777TokensSender.

ERC777-K interpretation:
    - cannot implement this in ERC777-K because we don't model EVM accounts that implement contracts
    - a hook in EVM-K is just some code inside a cell.

NOTE 2: An address can register at most one implementation at any given time for all ERC777 tokens.
    Hence the ERC777TokensSender MUST expect to be called by different token contracts.
    The msg.sender of the tokensToSend call is expected to be the address of the token contract.
ERC777-K interpretation:
    - also cannot model this in ERC777-K because we only have one ERC777 token in ths semantics.
    - tokensToSend hook is associated with the token holder address.

When hook not implemented:
    - There is no particular action to take if tokensToSend is not implemented.

Test variables
=================================

Test variables, a single send operation:
--------------------
    - send(), operatorSend(), operatorSend() to caller.
    - regular holder with no hook, contract holder with no hook, accepting hook, reverting hook.
        - will consider only addresses 9 and 10 as contracts, the rest are regular, for safety.
        - by default no hooks should be registered
        - a hook is associated with an address.
    - sufficient balance/insufficient balance/overflow/unauthorized operator

Test variables, multiple send operations:
--------------------
    - send from same address by multiple operators. Check that same hook is called.
    - send by one operator from multiple holders that use different hooks.
    - send by one operator from one holder to multiple destinations. Destinations also has a hook attached.
        Checks that hook is not associated with destination.

Test scenarios
=================================

A single send operation:
----------------------------------
On all tests, 3 operations:
    - send() to other address,  operatorSend() through default operator, operatorSend() from caller.
    - the hook prints some message with details about its parameters.

Already tested by other tests:
- regular holder address with no hook, sending sufficient balance
- regular holder address with no hook, sending more than balance
- regular holder address with no hook, sending overflow
- regular holder address with no hook, sending through unauthorized operator

Tests:
1. contract holder address with no hook, sending sufficient balance
2. contract holder address with no hook, sending more than balance
3. contract holder address with no hook, sending overflow
4. contract holder address with no hook, sending through unauthorized operator
5-8: sender hook, always accepting
9-12: sender hook, always rejecting

Multiple send operations:
----------------------------------
    13. One holder address with accepting hook. Perform operatorSend() from 2 operators.
    14. 2 Holder addresses, one accepting another rejecting. Send by one operator
        from 1st, then 2nd, then 1st.
    15. One holder and 2 destinations. Holder and one destination has accepting hook, the other destination has
        rejecting hook. Send to both destinations through operatorSend, through a default operator.
        Both operations should go through.

Total: 15 tests.
