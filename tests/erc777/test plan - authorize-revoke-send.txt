Authorize and revoke alone
================================
Rules for authorize:
    - may authorize non-caller
    - may authorize a default operator
    - may authorize an already authorized operator
    - may NOT authorize caller
    - may have multiple operators

Rules for revoke:
    - may revoke non-caller
    - may revoke a default operator
    - may revoke a non-authorized operator
    - may NOT revoke caller
    - may have multiple operators

Scenarios to test, authorize:
-------------------------------
    - authorize unauthorized non-caller non-default
    - authorize unauthorized non-caller default (revoke first)
    - authorize authorized non-caller non-default (authorize twice)
    - authorize authorized non-caller default
    - authorize caller non-default
    - authorize caller default

Scenarios to test, revoke:
-------------------------------
    - revoke unauthorized non-caller non-default
    - revoke unauthorized non-caller default (revoke first)
    - revoke authorized non-caller non-default (authorize first)
    - revoke authorized non-caller default
    - revoke caller non-default
    - revoke caller default

Scenarios to test, isOperatorFor, all cases in one test:
-------------------------------
State:
    - 2 token holders - 6 and 7
    - 2 default operators: 8 and 9. Both authorized for 6, just 9 authorized for 7.
    - 2 regular operators: 1 and 2. Both authorized for 6, just 2 authorized for 7.
Test:
    - isOperatorFor({1,2,8,9}, {6,7})


Additional things to log: call test.isOperatorFor after each authorize/revoke event.

Authorize and revoke with operatorSend, in addition to what was tested
================================
Scenarios to test, one operator:
-------------------------------
    - authorize non-default, send, revoke same, send.
    - authorize non-default, send, send
    - (unauthorized non-default) send, authorize, send
    - revoke default, send, authorize same, send

Scenarios to test, multiple operators:
-------------------------------
    - authorize 2 non-default operators, send from each and from one default.
    - one authorized and one non-authorized, send from each in order
    - one un-authorized and one authorized, send from each in order
    - authorize same operator by 2 accounts. Send from these 2 and from a 3-rd unauthorized.

Total: 21 tests.
